    "We want to figure out how the camera moved from frame 1 to frame 2.\n",
    "This is a geometry problem.\n",
    "Since each frame is a 2-D projection of 3-D physical space, the mathematical field of [projective geometry](https://www.britannica.com/science/projective-geometry) comes in handy.\n",
    "To be honest, I don't fully understand projective geometry the way I do regular (Euclidean) geometry, but it doesn't seem entirely necessary for this particular application.\n",
    "I will definitely be learning that more deeply as time goes on, but [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zRqk16wsdoCCLpou-dGo7QQNks1Ppzo) is an interim explanation that should prove useful (yes, the whole playlist)."
